## Part 1
# Mr. Jo√£o is a merchant and he needs a software that calculates the discount percentage he will 
# give to his customers on the total purchase amount. Create a software that asks for the total 
# order value, asks for the percentage, and then displays the discounted value and the amount discounted.
# If the discounted total value is less than 10, offer an additional item.

## Part 2
# Change the system to ask which product the customer took and the total value of that item.
# If the discounted total value is less than 10, offer an additional product in the order.
# Ask for the name of that product and its value.
# The discount of x% will be applied to the total value of the items.
# If the customer wants to add more items, display the list of items with their respective prices.
# Display the sum of the prices of all items.
# Allow the user to input as many items as they want.
