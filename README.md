### Discount Calculator: 📈
This project provides a software solution for Mr. João, a merchant, who needs a tool to calculate the discount percentage he will offer to his customers based on the total purchase amount. The software asks for the total order value, the discount percentage, and then displays the discounted value and the amount discounted. Additionally, if the discounted total value is less than 10, the software offers an additional item in the order worth 15.

### How to Use: ⚙️
1 - Run the program in a Ruby environment.

2 - Enter the name of the product that the customer took when prompted.

3 - Provide the total order value.

4 - Enter the discount percentage.

5 - The software will calculate the discounted value and the amount discounted.

6 - If the discounted total value is less than 10, the software will ask if you want to add any items (respond with 'Y' or 'N').

7 - If you choose 'Y', an additional item worth 15 will be added to the order.

8 - The software will display the product's name, price, and any additional item added.
